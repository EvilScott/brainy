It was originally created as part of \r\nthe Neural NFL project [here](https://github.com/EvilScott/neuralnfl), but was broken out into a gem to be more reusable.\r\n\r\n_NOTE_: As of v2.0 Brainy is _JRuby only_. This decision was made for performance reasons, as it can now leverage the fast linear algebra functionality\r\nfound in the [JBLAS](http://jblas.org/) Java library.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nBrainy is hosted on [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/brainy/) making installation easy.\r\n```\r\n$ gem install brainy\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nFrom [examples/sin.rb](https://github.com/EvilScott/brainy/blob/master/examples/sin.rb):\r\n```ruby\r\n# Example using sin wave function\r\nrequire 'brainy'\r\nnet = Brainy::Network.new(1, 3, 1, learning_rate: 1.0)\r\n\r\n# training\r\n4000.times do\r\n  i = rand(0..(Math::PI/2))\r\n  o = Math.sin(i)\r\n  net.train!([i], [o])\r\nend\r\n\r\n# testing\r\nmse = 1000.times.map do\r\n  i = rand(0..(Math::PI/2))\r\n  o = Math.sin(i)\r\n  (o - net.evaluate([i]).first) ** 2\r\nend.reduce(:+) / 1000\r\n\r\nputs \"your MSE: #{ mse.round(6) }\" # smaller is better\r\n```\r\n",
